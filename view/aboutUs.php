            The hexa#words project was created in the framework of the DUT MMI by the teacher GaÃ«lle Charpentier. The result of this project is to create a website combining a word and a color. The word in question is the hexadecimal counterpart for the color.

        <h5>The concept</h5>
        <p>
            The word chosen for the hexa#word project is the word "idiots". Declined under the following color:
        </p>
            <div class="carre"></div>
            <code>#1D1075</code>
        </article>
        <p class="concept">
            This word and this color will be put in the form of a site where it will be possible to choose a character in a random way and to give him a name as well as an anecdote. Indeed, the Internet users who want to, will tell in the manner of the site <a href="https://www.viedemerde.fr/">www.viedemerde.fr</a> a moment when they felt stupid. To implement this, the user would navigate between several pages.
